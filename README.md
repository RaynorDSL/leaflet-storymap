## Create Your Own
To create this map, we followed the procedure found in the open-source book _Hands-On Data Visualization_ by Jack Dougherty and Ilya Ilyankou. They provide a step-by-step tutorial at: https://HandsOnDataViz.org/leaflet-storymaps-with-google-sheets.html. 

You can also contact the Digital Scholarship Lab to set up a consultation to discuss creating your own Leaflet Storymap by visiting the [Digital Scholarship Consultation request form](https://www.marquette.edu/library/digital-scholarship/services/consultations.php).
